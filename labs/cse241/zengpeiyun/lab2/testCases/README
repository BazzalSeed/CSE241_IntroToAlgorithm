README FOR TEST CASES

Here are some test cases on which to exercise your hash table code.

** CASE 1

These are some very short sequences just to help you test your
implementation.  If you use match length = 4, you should get the following
output:

7 3 tacc
7 17 tacc
8 4 accc
9 5 ccca
12 10 atag
13 11 tagg
19 20 catt
20 21 atta
21 22 ttag
25 4 accc


** CASE 2

These sequences contain the human and mouse genes for preproinsulin, the
protein that is processed into the insulin hormone that regulates blood
sugar.  

If you use match length = 16, you should get the following output:

151 156 gtctagttgcagtagt
152 157 tctagttgcagtagtt
153 158 ctagttgcagtagttc
154 159 tagttgcagtagttct
155 160 agttgcagtagttctc
156 161 gttgcagtagttctcc
157 162 ttgcagtagttctcca
158 163 tgcagtagttctccag
159 164 gcagtagttctccagc
160 165 cagtagttctccagct
161 166 agtagttctccagctg
162 167 gtagttctccagctgg
163 168 tagttctccagctggt
164 169 agttctccagctggta
165 170 gttctccagctggtag
166 171 ttctccagctggtaga
167 172 tctccagctggtagag
168 173 ctccagctggtagagg
169 174 tccagctggtagaggg

179 184 agagggagcagatgct
180 185 gagggagcagatgctg
181 186 agggagcagatgctgg
182 187 gggagcagatgctggt
211 216 acaatgccacgcttct
212 217 caatgccacgcttctg
213 218 aatgccacgcttctgc
817 1121 tgggtgtgtagaagaa
818 1122 gggtgtgtagaagaag
819 1123 ggtgtgtagaagaagc
820 1124 gtgtgtagaagaagcc
939 1243 gccagcaggggcagga
956 1260 gcgcatccacagggcc
957 1261 cgcatccacagggcca
958 1262 gcatccacagggccat
959 1263 catccacagggccatg

From the output you see here, can you guess approximately which parts of
the two sequences encode the gene?  Hint: sequences that encode a common
gene tend to differ less than sequences that do not.  Also, a gene can
occur in multiple pieces (called "exons") with gaps in between.

** CASE 3

These sequences come from the mnd2 locus.  The mnd2 gene encodes a
protein important to correct functioning of the nerves that carry
impulses from the brain to the muscles.  In mice, mutations in this
gene cause "motor neuron degeneration 2" syndrome, which is closely
related to certain kinds of muscular dystrophy in humans.
 
The two sequences in this case come from the human and mouse genomes.
There is no mask sequence.  


** CASE 4

These sequences come from the human and mouse HOX-D loci. HOX genes
are essential to early development; they control important stuff like
which bits of your body have arms and legs attached.  In fruit flies,
a mutation in one of these genes produces a fly that sprouts legs on
its head, where its anntenae should be!
 
The common repeats in these sequences have been removed with a program
called RepeatMasker, which replaces them with n's.  There is a mask
sequence that filters out most (sadly, not all) of the matches between
these n's.  This locus contains regions of very high similarity, so to
avoid generating huge amounts of output, use match length = 180.
